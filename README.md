- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @paddeaux (Paddy) and I am an avid/aspiring Data Scientist. I will graduate from my MSc in Data Science & Analytics this year from Maynooth University, before commencing study in the Science Foundation of Irelands Centre for Research Training in Foundations of Data Science PhD programme - a fully funded 4-year programme.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m particularly interested in big data, open data, spatial databases, and machine learning.
- Some of the projects I've worked on include:
  - Analysis of COVID-19 case data by county in Ireland (using R, ggplot, tmap, shiny)
  - Analysis of the distribution of Konbini (convenience stores) in Tokyo (using postgreSQL, postGIS, QGIS) 
  - Spatial analysis of the American National Football League (NFL)
  - MSc Project: Python tool for random generation of realistic spatial data for assessment

- I currently work full-time as a University Tutor at Maynooth's Department of Computer Science
