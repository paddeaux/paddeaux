- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @paddeaux (Paddy) and I am a PhD student in the SFI's Centre for Research Training Programme in the Foundations of Data Science @ Maynooth University, Ireland. I previously graduated with MSc in Data Science & Analytics, a Higher Diploma in Data Analytics, and a BSc in Computer Science from Maynooth University
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m particularly interested in big data, open data, spatial databases, and machine learning.
- Some of the projects I've worked on include:
  - Generation of realistic synthetic spatial data for use in classroom assessments (MSc Project)
  - Analysis of COVID-19 case data by county in Ireland (using R, ggplot, tmap, shiny)
  - Analysis of the distribution of Konbini (convenience stores) in Tokyo (using postgreSQL, postGIS, QGIS) 
  - Spatial analysis of the American National Football League (NFL)

- I currently work part-time as a computer lab demonstrator with the Maynooth Department of Computer Science and I previously worked full-time as a tutor in the department, overseeing the running of the Computer Science Centre (CSC).
