- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @paddeaux (Paddy) and I am currently undertaking a Higher Diploma in Data Analytics. Since my average is a 1.1 (first-class honours) I'll be able to study for another year part time and achieve a MSc in Data Science & Analytics
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m particularly interested in big data, open data, spatial databases, and machine learning.
- Some of the projects I've worked on include:
  - Analysis of COVID-19 case data by county in Ireland (using R, ggplot, tmap, shiny)
  - Analysis of the distribution of Konbini (convenience stores) in Tokyo (using postgreSQL, postGIS, QGIS) 
- I'm currently looking for summer/part time work in Data Analytics to keep me going for the summer and potentially while I'm studying for my Masters
